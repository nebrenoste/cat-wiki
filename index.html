                        <p>Cat (lat. Felis catus) is a pet, one of the most popular (along with a dog) "companion animals".</p>       
            
           <p class="text">From the point of view of scientific systematics, the domestic cat is a mammal of the feline family of the order of predators. Often the domestic cat is considered as a subspecies of the forest cat (Felis silvestris) - Felis s. catus, but in terms of modern biological systematics (2017), the domestic cat is a separate biological species.

            As a solitary hunter of rodents and other small animals, the cat is a social animal that uses a wide range of sound signals as well as pheromones and body movements to communicate.
            
            Today there are about 600 million domestic cats in the world, about 200 breeds ranging from long-haired (Persian cat) to hairless (Sphynx), recognized and registered by various felinological organizations.
            
            For 10,000 years, cats have been valued by humans, including for their ability to hunt rodents and other domestic pests.</p>

            <h2><li>Scientific classification</li></h2>
                <img class="cat" src="cat2.jpg">
            <p class="text">In 1758, Carl Linnaeus in his "System of Nature" gave the domestic cat the binomial name Felis catus. Johann Christian von Schreber in 1775 gave the wild cat the name Felis silvestris.

                On the basis of data obtained by modern phylogenetics, the domestic cat is one of the five subspecies of the wild cat Felis silvestris, and its correct international scientific name is Felis silvestris catus. The decision to name the wild cat F. silvestris and its domesticated subspecies F. silvestris catus was made in 2003 by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, and it was specified that if in any classification the domestic cat would be described as a separate species, then the combination proposed by Linnaeus - F. catus should be used to name the corresponding taxon.
                
                In literature there are also other names used as international scientific (Latin-speaking) names of house cats: Felis catus domesticus, Felis silvestris domesticus, and also the name Felis domesticus proposed in 1777 by Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in the Elements of Natural History (originally Felis domestica, because the word Felis in those days was considered feminine). All these names are part of the synonymy of the taxon, and therefore should not be used.
                
                As the Russian name of this taxon in scientific (popular scientific) literature is used both the expression "domestic cat" (or "domestic cat"), and simply the word "cat".

            <h2><li>Origin and history of domestication</li></h2>
                <img class="cat1" src="dz.jpg">
            <p class="text">According to a genetic study of autosomal markers and mitochondrial DNA of 979 domestic, wild and feral cats from three continents, including barchan cats (Felis margarita), all domestic cats in the maternal line descend from at least five female representatives of the steppe cat (Felis silvestris lybica) subspecies with different mitochondrial DNA haplotypes. In the mitochondrial haplogroup IV, specific for the Middle Eastern and domestic cats, 6 subclades were identified and the lifetime of the common ancestor was calculated as about 13 thousand years ago, which significantly exceeds the estimated time of domestication of the Middle Eastern cats. Genetic analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of 209 cats from 30 burials in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa showed that domestic cats spread around the world in two large waves. The first wave took place at the dawn of agriculture 12,000-9,000 years ago - in and around the Fertile Crescent, domestic cats were dispersed along with farmers throughout the Middle East. Several thousand years later, the second wave that came out of Egypt covered almost all of Europe and North Africa.</p>
            
            <p>The isolation of the subspecies Felis silvestris lybica occurred about 130,000 years ago. The steppe cat is still widespread throughout North Africa and in a wide area from the Mediterranean to China, where it lives in saksaul thickets in deserts, in bushes near water bodies, in the foothills and mountains. Although small wild cats of different subspecies may interbreed with each other and give birth, genetic studies have shown that other subspecies of Felis silvestris, except for the steppe cat, did not participate in phylogenesis of the domestic cat.</p>
        
            <p>Domestication of the cat occurred about 9,500 years ago in the Middle East in the Fertile Crescent, where the oldest human civilizations originated and developed. The domestication of the cat began with man's transition to a settled way of life, with the development of agriculture, when there was a surplus of food and the need to preserve it and protect it from rodents arose.</p>
        
            <p>The oldest archaeological evidence of cat domestication was found in Cyprus, where during the archaeological excavations a common grave of a man and a cat was found, which dates back to 7500 B.C. It was also found that the island of Cyprus was colonized by people from the areas of modern Anatolia (Turkey) and Syria.</p>
                <img class="cat" src="heart.jpg">
            <p>Previously, scientists believed that the ancient Egyptians were the first to domesticate cats. However, the earliest evidence of domestication of cats by the ancient Egyptians dates back to 2000-1900 BC. And recently it has been found that in ancient Egypt, the domestic cat came, like in Cyprus, from the territory of Anatolia. Currently, the cat is one of the most popular pets.</p>
        
            <p>Although cats were domesticated quite a long time ago, most cats are able to survive outside human habitation, joining the ranks of secondary feral cats, as cats usually quickly become re-domesticated in the stray environment. Secondarily feral cats often live solitary and hunt alone, but sometimes form small colonies of several females with kittens.</p>

            <img class="cat" src="doctor.jpg">
        <p class="text">The average life span of cats is 14 years. At the same time, there is a known case where a cat named Cream Puff lived to be 38 years old. As of January 2011, the oldest cat in the world was Lucy. She lived with a British family and celebrated her 39th birthday. According to the owner Bill Thomas, the cat was born in 1972. The representatives of Guinness Book of Records officially recognized Lucy as the oldest cat of its kind in the world.</p>

        <p>Neutering cats and neutering cats are beneficial to their health, since neutering cats cannot develop cancer of the testes, and neutering cats cannot develop uterine or ovarian cancer, and both cats and neutering cats have a decreased risk of breast cancer[96]. Neutering cats before their first heat is a prevention of mammary cancer. However, neutered cats often suffer from urolithiasis and are prone to obesity. Early castration (at less than 8-9 months of age) can lead to the development of urolithiasis.</p>

        <p>The lifespan of stray cats is difficult to determine accurately. However, according to one study, the average age of these animals is 4.7 years, and that part of the stray cats die while still kittens, although some can survive up to 10 years. In modern city conditions stray cats usually live no more than two years, but in managed colonies stray neutered cats can live much longer. The British Cat Action Trust reports that the oldest known stray cat was 19 years old. The oldest known stray cat was 26-year-old Mark, who was in the care of the Cat Welfare Alliance.</p>

            <h2><li>Cat genetics</li></h2>
        <p class="text">Cats are carnivorous animals. Unlike canines - dogs, wolves, jackals, foxes, coyotes - which are omnivores and therefore often diversify animal foods with plant foods and can easily become vegetarians, cats usually consume only meat foods, to which their digestive tract is adapted. First of all, their well-developed fangs allow them to chew their food; the cat's long and agile tongue has special tubercles on its sides that allow it to separate meat from the skeleton of its prey. These tubercles also secrete keratin and help the cat in washing. When chewing, the cat's head lowers to the side of the jaw with which the cat chews. Since both chewing muscles are underdeveloped, the cat often changes the side of the jaw it chews with.</p>
        
        <p>A cat's intestines, like those of many carnivores, are fairly short and do not exceed 1.8 m in length. The cat's stomach performs the function of digestion, and the cat needs to periodically clean it of undigested food particles: bones, tendons, and its own hair. Stomach cleansing is provided by vomiting, which is a normal protective reflex but can also be a symptom of illness. It is advisable to give the cat herbs of specially sprouted wheat to prevent clogging of the cat's stomach with hairballs.</p>
        
        <p>Secondarily feral cats, as well as cats with access outside the home, eat small prey, mostly rodents and birds. Even cats that are provided with nutritious food by their owners prey on small mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, fish, and invertebrates if they have access outside the home. Cats prefer to eat small meals several times a day.</p>
        
        <p>Cats should not be deprived of meat food because it is impossible to synthesize all the amino acids they need from plant food. One of the most important substances for cats is taurine, the absence of which in the diet leads to poor health and can cause blindness due to the degradation of the central retinal area. Cow's milk is a poor source of taurine, in addition, most cats are lactose intolerant, and consumption of milk leads to digestive disorders in cats.</p>
    
        <p>Cats need vitamin A from animal foods because, unlike many other animals, they cannot synthesize it from beta-carotene (also called pro-vitamin A), which requires an enzyme that is not present in the cat's body. As in many other mammals, vitamin C is synthesized in the cat from glucose.</p>
    
        <p>Cats sometimes adapt to certain kinds of human foods, but these foods are harmful to the cat and can provoke a number of illnesses (such as urolithiasis, chronic renal failure), and the consumption of chocolate, cocoa, coffee can even lead to severe poisoning and death of the animal.</p>
    
        <p>Also, some cats may eat small amounts of vegetables, fruits, and bread. The presence of1-2 teaspoons of cottage cheese or kefir in the diet is desirable.

            To improve the digestive system and to induce vomiting to cleanse the stomach of hair, cats periodically swallow grass, leaves and young shoots of plants. In the absence of suitable grasses, cats can eat rose petals, for example. Sometimes, if there is a lack of micronutrients in the food, cats may eat soil.</p>
